<h3>JUnit Helper Eclipse Plugin</h3>
<p>
"JUnit Helper" is an open-source project helping JUnit users to cover all tests for public, protected and package local methods by saving much labor to start writing new test cases.
</p>
<p>
Eclipse plugin also has an advantage of making it easier to go back and forth between developing class and test class by "Alt + 8 "(test->dev) and "Alt + 9"(dev->test).
